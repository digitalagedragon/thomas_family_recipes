1 pound (1 large bunch) asparagus
2 Tbsp sugar
1/4 C hot water
1/4 C white or light miso paste

Position an oven rack 6 inches under the broiler element and preheat
the broiler (to high if your broiler has different settings).

Trim the bottom 1 inch off the asparagus stalks. If any are bigger
than a pencil, use a vegetable peeler to peel an additional 2 or 3
inches' worth of the skin from the bottom of the stalks.

Whisk together the sugar and water in a small bowl, stirring until the
sugar dissolves, then whisk in the miso paste.

Arrange the asparagus in a single layer in a shallow roasting pan or
rimmed baking sheet. Spoon the miso mixture over the asparagus,
turning the stalks so they are evenly coated.

Broil until the asparagus is lightly browned and the miso is bubbling,
6 to 8 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.
