Brown sausage in a pan.  Toss in homemade spaghetti sauce, and penne.
Cover, and let simmer for X minutes, stirring every five minutes or so
to prevent sticking.  Actually, "X" above ended up being about 70, and
everything was overcooked, so just boil the penne in water, drain it,
and mix it in with the sauce and sausage.


Add moz to cover the top, and broil on high until bubbly and a little
browned. At the Cedar St. house, that was 13:30, with the oven rack on
the bottom because it was a pain to move with a pizza stone on it and
I didn’t have a second rack in the oven.
