Thinking about trying sourdough buns, based off:

http://www.recipezaar.com/Sourdough-Burger-Buns-135870

I've halved the original recipe to make four buns, and tweaked a little
to get some more milk in:

1 cup sourdough starter, proofed and active
2 tablespoons butter
1/2 cup milk, lukewarm
1 eggs, beaten
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoons sugar
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

The above may be a little damp - it may want up to another half cup
of flour.

Below recipe is 2 1/4:3/4 (3:1) ratio flour to liquid. Assuming
sourdough starter is 50/50 water and flour, and we want 1/2 C milk, since
we have 1C total of liquid, we'd need 3C total of flour, which is 2 1/2 C.

20090404:  Made as below (1/8 oz yeast), which took about 90 minutes
to rise.

My plan:

1/2 cup milk
1/4 cup water
2 Tbsp butter
2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (270 g +30 +30 +15)
1/8 oz instant yeast (1 1/8 tsp)
1 tablespoon white sugar
3/4 teaspoons salt
1 egg

This may be a little "eggy" since it's hard to divide an egg in half.
May have to add a bit more flour to make the consistency correct.

In a small saucepan, heat the milk, water and butter until about 120
degrees F.

Beat an egg in a separate bowl.

Pour 1C of flour into the bread machine, along with yeast, sugar and
salt. Add the milk mixture, and begin "knead" cycle. Once dough is
combined, add the egg. Add remaining flour 1C at a time as mixture
is combined. When all ingredients are in, allow the "knead" cycle to
complete, but stop before rise.

Divide the dough into 6 equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and
place on a greased cooking sheet. Let rest a couple of minutes, then
flatten slightly (about four inches thick?). Let rise until doubled.
This is listed as 35-45 minutes in most sources, but since I've halved
the yeast, it could be as long as 90 minutes.

When risen, bake at 400 F for 10 to 12 minutes, or until golden brown.

 INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)


    * 1 cup milk     * 1/2 cup water     * 1/4 cup butter   
 * 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour     * 1 (.25 ounce) package instant
yeast     * 2 tablespoons white sugar     * 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
    * 1 egg




 DIRECTIONS


   1. In a small saucepan, heat milk, water and butter until very warm,
120 degrees F (50 degrees C).     2. In a large bowl, mix together
1 3/4 cup flour, yeast, sugar and salt. Mix milk mixture into flour
mixture, and then mix in egg. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at
a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled
together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until
smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.     3. Divide dough into 12
equal pieces. Shape into smooth balls, and place on a greased baking
sheet. Flatten slightly. Cover, and let rise for 30 to 35 minutes.
   4. Bake at 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) for 10 to 12 minutes,
or until golden brown.     5. For Hot Dog Buns: Shape each piece into
a 6x4 inch rectangle. Starting with the longer side, roll up tightly,
and pinch edges and ends to seal. Let rise about 20 to 25 minutes. Bake
as above. These buns are pretty big. I usually make 16 instead of 12.
