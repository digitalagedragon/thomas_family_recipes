Updated order with when I actually made things.

Next year, can make Mac & Cheese, Stuffing, and Green Bean Casserole
the day before.

On the stuffing, if you halve the recipe, don't put it in too big a pan
- it wants a small (9" x 12") pan so it'll be deep enough not to
overcook.

Do NOT start the green beans and the creamed onions at the same
time. The green beans will be done in about ten minutes and the onions
want about twenty-five.

Menu:

Roast Turkey au jus with stuffing
Garlic Mashed Potatoes
Mom's Cranberry Relish
Canned Cranberry Sauce
Macaroni and Cheese
Spiced Peaches
Green Bean Casserole
Green Beans with Bacon
Creamed Onions
Roasted Sweet Potatoes with Marshmallows
Dinner Rolls
Hot Cider

Key Lime Pie w/Whipped Cream
Pecan Pie
Pumpkin Spice Ice Cream

Supper served at 1400?
