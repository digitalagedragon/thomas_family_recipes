Post-dinner thoughts:

The turkey turned out *really* well, but internal temperature target
should be more like 145 if you can pull it off. (Cooked 1 hour at 425
convection to give it a golden skin, then 24 hours at the lowest temp
on the oven; we got up to about 155F).

Green beans were fine but I think the flavor's a little subtle for a
plate with so many big flavors on it.

This year we had 7 diners and needed easily twice as many mashed
potatoes

Need to halve the stuffing recipe, that was an insane amount of
stuffing

Make the desserts two days ahead. Suggested order for 2019:

Tuesday:
  Pies, cakes, cranberry relish, spiced peaches

Wednesday:
  Mac & Cheese
  Stuffing
  Candied Yams
  Turkey goes in the oven
  Turkey jus

Thursday:
  Green Beans
  Creamed onions
  Dinner rolls
  Garlic Mashed Potatoes

Nathan suggests Spiced Peaches
