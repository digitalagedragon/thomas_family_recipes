2 cans (10-3/4 ounces each) condensed cream of mushroom soup
1 cup whole milk
2 teaspoons soy sauce
1/8 teaspoon pepper
2 packages (16 ounces each) frozen green beans, cooked and drained
1 can (6 ounces) french-fried onions, divided

In a bowl, combine soup, milk, soy sauce and pepper. Gently stir in
beans. Spoon half of the mixture into a 13x9-in. baking dish. Sprinkle
with half of the onions. Spoon remaining bean mixture over the
top. Sprinkle with remaining onions.

Bake at 350Â° until heated through and onions are brown and crispy,
30-35 minutes.
