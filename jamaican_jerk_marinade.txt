2 medium yellow onions
2 scallions, chopped
3 cloves garlic
2 hot peppers, chopped (Scotch peppers are traditional, can skip for
  kids, or 1 tsp ground red pepper for kids)
4 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 tsp ground thyme (or 4 tsp fresh thyme)
2 tsp ground Jamaican Allspice
2 tsp black pepper
1 tsp ground nutmeg
1 tsp cinnamon
6 Tbsp soy sauce
2 Tbsp olive oil
2 Tbsp cider vinegar

Put it all in the blender and liquify it. Â Looks like lime juice is a
common addition, but I don't have any (10/12/10).
