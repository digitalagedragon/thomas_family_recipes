New:

1 lbs fresh cranberries
2 large oranges, zested and peeled
1 1/2 C sugar

Add all three items (discarding the orange pith) to the food processor
and process until combined. Refrigerate overnight to let flavors combine.


Old, not-Mom like:

1 package cranberries
Zest from two large oranges
1 1/2C to 2C sugar

Combine all in a saucepan and cook until the cranberries pop (about five
minutes). Refrigerate up to a week; make at least a day before use
(the longer, the better)
