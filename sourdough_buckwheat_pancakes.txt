The night before:


2 C warm milk (95F)
1 C (147g) buckwheat flour
1/4 C (90g) sourdough starter


Mix, cover, and put in a warm place overnight.


The next morning:


2 eggs
2 Tbsp melted butter


1 C (120g) all-purpose flour
3/4 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp sugar




If you don't have overnight, you can still mix this the same morning and get something decent. The more time for the sourdough to ferment, the better, but it's not a huge difference.
