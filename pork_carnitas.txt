1/2 C roughly chopped cilantro
2 limes, cut into wedges
2 C shredded cabbage

Set pot to saut√© on high.

Season the roast with salt and pepper. 

Spray pot with cooking oil spray, and brown the pork on all sides
(approximately 3 minutes per side).

Remove from heat and allow to cool. Using a sharp knife, slide the
garlic slivers into the pork roast, all over.

Season pork with cumin, sazon, oregano, adobo, and garlic powder, all

pressure release (about 25 minutes).

Remove the roast from the pot, and shred using two forks. Combine with
some of the juices left in the pot for moister pork.
