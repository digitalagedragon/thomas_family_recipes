1 Tbsp olive oil 1 (3 - 5 pound) boneless chuck roast (cross-rib is also
nice), trimmed 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black
pepper 2 coarsely chopped onions 2 cups dry red wine 4 thyme sprigs 8
garlic cloves, chopped (or pressed or smashed) 2 cups low-sodium beef
broth or bone broth 1 bay leaf

4 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch pieces (this step should
be done after the roast is in the oven) 20 small potatoes, washed (ditto)
2 lbs whole mushrooms (optional), washed (ditto ditto) 2 Tbsp flour


Pre-heat an oven to 350F


Coat the roast in olive oil, and sear with a blowtorch (or, optionally,
brown on all sides in a dutch oven)


Add to a dutch oven the roast, salt, pepper, onions, wine, thyme, garlic,
broth and bay leaf. Bring to a simmer on a stovetop, cover, and place
in the oven for 1 1/2 hours.


Remove the dutch oven, and add the carrots and potatoes. Cover and return
to oven for 1 hour.


Remove the dutch oven from the oven. Remove everything from the oven
except the liquid, discarding the thyme stems. Set vegetables and meat
aside, covered under foil.


Pour the liquid through a sieve into a gravy separator, and let stand
five minutes to allow the fat to rise. While this happens, rinse out
the dutch oven with just water to remove anything big remaining in it.


Separate the fat and the liquid. Pour the fat into the dutch oven, and
heat over medium heat until hot. Add the flour to the dutch oven, and
whisk to combine. Let cook for 1 minute, then slowly add the reserved
liquid, whisking as you add in order to prevent lumps.


Raise heat to high. If desired, add the mushrooms. Boil for 10
minutes. Remove the mushrooms from the sauce, and serve.
