The below seemed like it would be too fishy and too salty, so, here's
my version:

1 small onion, chopped
6 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pound green beans, trimmed and halved
2 medium tomatoes, in 16ths or so (big chunks)
1/4 C chicken broth (subs. sake or water)
2 Tbsp fish sauce
1 Tbsp low-salt soy sauce Stir-fry oil

Heat the wok and put in stir-fry oil. Add the onion and garlic, cook
and stir for a couple of minutes. Add green beans and tomatoes, and
stir. Add soy sauce and fish sauce, stir-frying for about 2 minutes.
Add chicken broth, cover, and steam until beans are done (about five
minutes).

Added about 1 Tbsp flour to thicken the sauce. Probably double to
2 Tbsp. 2 Tbsp fish sauce was a bit too much - try 1 Tbsp.  1 Tbsp
low-salt soy sauce was a bit too much - try 2 tsp.

Steamed the beans for four minutes (stirring at three), which wasn't
quite enough. Try five minutes, as the recipe suggests.

1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil
1/2 yellow onion, chopped
1 teaspoon minced garlic
1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and halved
1/4 cup soy sauce
3 tablespoons nuoc mam (Vietnamese fish sauce)
1/4 cup water
1 medium tomato, diced
salt and pepper to taste

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic;
cook and stir for a few minutes then add the green beans. Stir to coat
with the flavors in the pan. Season with soy sauce and fish sauce and let
simmer for about 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Pour in the water and
let simmer for about 10 minutes, or until green beans are tender. Stir
in tomato and season with salt and pepper before serving.
