Marinade based off this:


2 5.5 oz cans of tomato juice

1/3 C apple cider vinegar

1 Tbsp worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp oil


1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp mustard
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp salt
1 bay leaf

Made "single serving" with a 4 pound chicken, skinless, cooked it one
hour and it came out great (with 30 minutes smoking, flipped once,
basting at flip).  Might be able to bake it 55 minutes and smoke it
longer, though.


Also - probably not a bad idea to pre-mix the sauce.  Oh, also, also,
forgot to grease the pan (used the Corningware) and it worked fine.

The notes below the dashes date from before now.  I've been making the
"single serving" with a whole cut-up chicken.  Last time we tried it
skin-on, and resolved to try it skin off, this time.


I substitute olive oil (and about half of it) for the butter.


Skin-on, I think, it can take 1 hour, 15 minutes cooking.  Skin-off we
made a small chicken at 1 hour, 15 minutes and it was dry - for
skin-off we should probably try 1 hour even.

I think this is my mom's smoked chicken recipie.  I found it in a
notebook which seems to date from the upstate NY years.  No cooking
times, yet, but here are the ingrediants.  She thinks this is a
tripling of the original recipie:


16 breasts (about 4 packs)
2 packs of drumsticks
6 cups canned tomato juice (48 oz)
1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
8 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 teaspoon mustard
18 teaspoons worchestershire sauce
4 bay leaves
4 teaspoons sugar
3 cups vinegar
12 tablespoons butter

Grease pan
Put chicken in pan
Bake in oven at 350 for an hour or until done


Hickory Smoke 20 - 30 minutes, basting once on each side
