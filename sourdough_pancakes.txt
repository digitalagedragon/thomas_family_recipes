These made crepe-like pancakes that everyone but Blake loved.

Finally I found a recipe in Nancy Silverton's Breads from the La Brea
Bakery that combines active starter with a small amount of maple syrup,
oil, eggs, salt, baking soda and powder. This sounded more like what I
was looking for, though I was surprised that even Silverton added baking
powder and soda, since she's a big advocate of natural leavening. Her
recipe also called for two eggs and 2 tablespoons of syrup per two cups
of starter, which struck me as a lot for that amount of flour. After
scaling back the eggs and sugar and substituting butter for oil, I
settled on the following recipe for my first attempt:


4 cups starter (!)  2 tablespoons syrup 3 tablespoons butter, melted 2
eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder


I fed the starter the night before, so it was active and bubbly
by morning. For flour I used a mix of bread flour (which is what I
normally put in starter) and all-purpose flour (which is normally used
for pancakes). In the morning we combined all the other ingredients,
added them to the starter, and mixed until just incorporated. (Too much
mixing would develop more gluten, meaning tougher pancakes.) Then we
cooked them off on a griddle over medium heat, adjusting the batter and
the temperature as needed so the pancakes spread nicely on the griddle
and don't stick.


The resulting pancakes were a big hit, less cakey and more bread-like
the most pancakes, but still light and fluffy, and with the expected,
barely-soured flavor. In short, they had character, and people seemed
to like them. I'll continue to experiment with the recipe -- next time
I may try skipping the baking soda and powder -- but for a first attempt
we were satisfied.


As an aside, I give a mixed review to Nancy Silverton's book. It's
full of excellent information, but many of the recipes are so detailed,
running onto multiple pages, that they're impossible to follow when your
up to your arms in dough. I believe recipes should always be separated
into the rambling part -- like I'm doing now -- and the procedural part,
which should be as succinct as possible. If you catch me violating this
rule, feel free to bust me.

Notes, 20090404 (Saturday):


  Started sponge at 0910.  Made everything Sunday.  Note baking powder
  below was an addition.  Nobody liked how these came out.


1 C warm water 1 C white flour 1/2 C sourdough starter dough (half a
tangerine ;) 2 C milk 2 1/2 C whole grain flour 3 large eggs 4 Tbsp sugar
(or maple syrup!)  3 Tbsp melted butter 2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp baking
soda 1 tsp salt


24 hours before, mix warm water, white flour and dough.  Cover and
let stand.


About fifteen minutes before baking, melt the butter, and combine with
eggs.  Add milk.  Then, mix all other ingredients together.

1 cup of sourdough starter (my starter is fed 3/4 cups of water and one
cup of flour, so it's the thinner type of starter) 2 cups of water 2 1/2
cups of whole grain flour 3 large eggs 4 tablespoons of maple syrup,
honey, maple sugar, or rapadura (optional) 1/4 cup of coconut oil,
or melted butter 1 teaspoon of baking soda 1 teaspoon of salt


3 to 24 hours before you want to eat, combine in a large bowl the starter,
water, and flour. Make sure that you have plenty of room for this mixture
to rise. If it is a very hot day, beware of leaving it too long as it
will ferment very quickly. I usually make this up the night before,
for breakfast, or the morning of, for dinner. In colder weather, I have
done this recipe for up to 24 hours.


After the soaking period, add the rest of the ingredients, and combine
well. A whisk is helpful. If you want thinner pancakes you can thin with
water (or milk). Drop about 1/4 of a cup of the batter on a lightly oiled
hot griddle (over medium to medium-high heat) until the the top is set,
and the bottom lightly browned. Flip the pancake and cook until the
pancake is lightly browned on the other side. Repeat until all of the
batter is used, re-oiling the pan as needed.
