Disolve the yeast in warm water, and let stand until frothy (5-10
minutes).  &nbsp; minutes, or until smooth.


Place the dough in an oiled, covered bowl and let rise for one hour.


Punch down the dough, and pinch off golf-ball sized balls.  &nbsp;

After 30 minutes, light the grill (assuming you're using charcoal), and
roll the balls out into thin circles.  &nbsp; piece should be brushed
