1 C (215g) white rice
  (N.B.! This is one ACTUAL cup, not rice-cooker cup, see liquid
  below)
1/2 medium onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped (or smashed if you're lazy like me)
2 Tbsp butter
1/2 tsp turmeric
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp salt
2C (500g) of chicken stock

If you're feeling particular, rinse the rice first; if you don't,
it'll brown a bit on the bottom.

Dump everything in the rice cooker and cook it on normal rice
setting.
