Serves two.


Essential: 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 cup (1.75 ounces) dark brown
sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg
2 bananas, sliced into half-inch rounds 1/4 cup dark rum 1 tablespoon
banana liqueur or (less ideally) 1 Tbsp dark rum Vanilla ice cream


Optional:

1/2 teaspoon finely grated orangeÂ 




Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the Tbsp of liquid,
then the brown sugar, allspice, and nutmeg. Stir until brown sugar is
melted. Add the bananas, and cook for one minute. Then, flip the bananas
and cook for one more minute.


Remove the bananas, increase heat, add the 1/4 C of rum, and light it
on fire. After the rum burns off, cook the sauce down for 1 - 2 minutes
until it is syrupy. If adding the orange zest, add it now. Add the 1
Tbsp of rum.


Serve the ice cream, place the banana slices over the ice cream, and
pour the sauce over the ice cream.
