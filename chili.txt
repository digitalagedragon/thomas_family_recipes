Suggestion from Tegan: 1 lbs of buffalo meat?


1 bay leaf



3 tsp salt
about 2 tablespoons bacon fat

1 medium onion, peeled and diced
2 carrots, peeled and diced
2 stalks celery, diced.
1 green pepper, diced.
7 cloves garlic, peeled and minced

3 teaspoons red chile powder
2 teaspoons dried oregano

2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
2 cups (50cl) beer
2 cans (15oz, 200g each) crushed or diced tomatoes
1 tablespoon brown sugar
1 tbsp cocoa powder
1 tablespoon cider vinegar or lime juice



Cover the beans in cold water and leave overnight.


The next evening, pour off the water from the beans, place them in a  saucepan, and just cover with water. Add the bay leaf, bring to a brisk boil, boil for ten minutes, and then reduce to a simmer. If the beans become uncovered, add more water.


In a large dutch oven (at least 6 qts), brown the beef in batches in the bacon fat. Set beef aside.


Add the onions, carrots, celery and green pepper to the dutch oven. Stir with a wooden spoon, being sure the scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the oven. Cook for about 6 minutes over medium heat, until onion is soft and translucent. Add garlic until fragrant, 30 seconds.


Add to the pot the tomatoes (with juice), beer, beans (with liquid), chile powder, oregano, cumin, paprika, brown sugar, salt and cocoa powder.


Bring to a boil, and then turn to a low simmer, uncovered. Simmer for at least two hours, or until thick. When desired thickness is reached, add the vinegar or lime juice, and serve.
