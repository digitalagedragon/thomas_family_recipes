Lime Filling:
     4 tsp grated zest and 1/2 C strained juice from 3 - 4 Persion
     limes (or 1 dozen Key Limes, but, see below)
     4 large egg yolks
     1 14 oz can sweetened condensed milk

Graham Cracker Crust:
9 graham crackers (5 oz), broken into rough pieces
2 Tbsp granulated sugar
5 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted and kept warm

Filling:
Whisk the zest and yolks into a medium nonreactive bowl until tinted
light green, about 2 minutes. Beat in the condensed milk, then the
juice; set aside at room temperature to thicken (about 30 minutes).

Crust:
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 325F.

In a food procesor, process the graham crackers until fine, about 30
seconds (makes about 1 C crumbs). Add the sugar and pulse to
combine. Continue to pulse while adding the warm melted butter in a
steady strewam; pulse until the mixture resembles wet sand.

Transfer the crumbs to a 9-inch glass pie plate and evenly press the
crumbs into the pie plate. Use your thumb and a 1/2C measuring cup to
square off the top of the crust.

Bake the crust until it is fragrant and beginning to brown, 15 - 18
minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and cool completely.

Pie:
Pour the lime filling into the crust; back until the center is set yet
wiggly when jiggled, 15 to 17 minutes. Return the pie to a wire rack;
cool to room temperature. Refridgerate until well chilled, at least
three hours. The pie can be covered directly with a lightly oiled or
oil-sprayed plastic wrap and refrigerated for up to one day).

NOTE: Actual Key Limes are harder to find, more expensive, and
significantly more work. Per "The New Best Recipe" (2004), they make
no noticeable difference in flavor.
