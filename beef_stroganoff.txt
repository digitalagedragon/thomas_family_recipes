This is an "easy weeknight meal" version, not authentic.

2 Tbsp unsalted butter
12 ounces cremini mushrooms, thickly sliced
1/2 medium sweet onion, diced
Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste
1 pound lean ground beef
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 tsp dried thyme
3 Tbsp all-purpose flour
1/4 C dry white wine
4 C beef stock
2 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce
1 Tbsp Dijon mustard
8 ounces egg noodles, uncooked
1/2 cup sour cream
2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves

Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and
onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until mushrooms are tender and
browned, about 3-5 minutes; season with salt and pepper, to taste.

Add ground beef and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure
to crumble the beef as it cooks.  Stir in garlic and thyme until
fragrant, about 1 minute.

Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.

Stir in wine, scraping any browned bits from the bottom of the
skillet.

Stir in beef stock, Worcestershire, Dijon and egg noodles; season with
salt and pepper, to taste. Bring to a boil; cover, reduce heat and
simmer until pasta is cooked through, about 9-10 minutes.

Stir in sour cream until heated through, about 1-2 minutes.
Serve immediately, garnished with parsley, if you can be arsed to.
