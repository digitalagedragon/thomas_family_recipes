1 Tbsp olive oil
2 sweet onions, diced
2 carrots, diced
2 stalks celery, diced
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/2 tsp freshly ground black pepper
1 lbs extra lean ground beef
1/2 lbs ground pork
1/4 lbs diced pancetta
7 cloves of garlic, minced
2 Tbsp tomato paste
1/2 Cup dry red wine
28 oz crushed San Marzano tomatoes
1/2 Cup chopped Italian parsley, split
1/4 Cup heavy cream Kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper

Heat pot. Add oil to coat bottom, and add the 2 Tbsp of tomato paste.

Sauté the onions, carrots, and celery until onions are translucent,
7 minutes.

Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute

Add beef, pork, pancetta, salt, and pepper. Break up and stir in until
meat is browned, 10 minutes

Deglaze the pan with the red wine, scraping to get any browned bits
up from the bottom. Add the tomatoes and half of the parsley. Set the
pressure cooker to “high” cook for twenty minutes. At the end of
20 minutes, do an immediate pressure release. When pressure is down,
take off lid, and cook on high heat for another 10 minutes to thicken
the sauce, stirring frequently.

Stir in the remaining parsley and cream.
