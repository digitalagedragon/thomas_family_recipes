Mine:


3/4 cup low-fat milk
2 large eggs
1/2 tsp vanilla


1 3/4 cups flour
3/4 cup sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup chocolate chips


Bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  Makes 12; put in 3-4 raspberries per muffin.


I strongly suspect (but have not checked) that you could replace the chips with 1 1/2 cups any fresh fruit and have something good.
