Crepes for 1 (or two);

1/2 C all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar
1 egg
1/4 C milk
1/4 C water
1 Tbsp butter, melted

Mix flour, salt and sugar in a bowl.

In a second bowl, Temper the egg and melted butter; then add the water.

Finally, combine and beat until smooth.

Use approximately 1/4C batter for each crepe; cook over medium high
heat on a greased crepe pan. Be sure to tilt the pan when you pour in
the batter so the batter is as thin as possible. Cook for about two
minutes, until the bottom is brown (and the top is dry). Loosen with
a spatula, and turn it.
