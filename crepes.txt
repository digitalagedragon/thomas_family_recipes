1/2 C all-purpose flour
1/4 tsp salt
1/2 tsp sugar

1/4 C water
1 Tbsp butter, melted


Mix flour, salt and sugar in a bowl.


In a second bowl, Temper the egg and melted butter; then add the
water.


Finally, combine and beat until smooth.


Use approximately 1/4C batter for each crepe; cook over medium high
heat on a greased crepe pan.  Be sure to tilt the pan when you pour
in the batter so the batter is as thing as possible.  Cook for about

 INGREDIENTS (Nutrition)


    * 1 cup all-purpose flour
    * 2 eggs
    * 1/2 cup milk
    * 1/2 cup water
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 2 tablespoons butter, melted


 DIRECTIONS


   1. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
   2. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
   3. Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
