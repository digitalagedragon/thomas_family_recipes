Broth:
1 large white onion, peeled and halved
3 inch piece of ginger, halved lengthwise
1 whole star anise
4 whole cloves
3 cinnamon sticks
2 cardamom pods
1 Tbsp whole coriander seeds
8 C high quality beef stock
1 Tbsp brown sugar
2 tsp fish sauce
2 tsp salt

Soup ingredients:
8 oz raw sirloin, sliced very thin
7 oz uncooked thin rice noodles

Garnishes:
Fresh Basil
Bean Sprouts
Lime Wedges
Thinly-sliced chilies (Thai bird or Jalepe√±o)
Thinly-sliced white onion
Hoisin Sauce
Shriracha Sauce

1. Lightly coat the onions and ginger in high-heat oil and then char
them with a blowtorch in a cast-iron pan

2. In a large stock pot, heat the anise, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom,
and coriander for three minutes or until fragrant. Add in the charred
onion, ginger, stock, and stir to combine.  Continue cooking until the
broth reaches a simmer.  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover with a
lid, and continue to simmer for at least 30 minutes. Strain out (and
discard) the onions, ginger and spices.  Stir in the fish sauce and
sweetener into the hot broth. Add salt, taste, and add more salt if
needed.

3. Cook the noodles al dente (they will continue cooking some in the
bowl) according to instructions, and place one serving's worth in each
bowl. Split the steak evenly between the bowls.

4. Ladle still-simmering soup into each bowl and serve immediately.

Makes 4 medium bowls.
