This printable recipe makes about 50 cookies.

Serves:

Prep Time:

Total Time: Ingredients

1 cup of soft butter (it is critical that it be soft)
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups regular all-purpose flour (240 g)
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
12-ounce package of M&Ms (see my secret in the box near the end of the page)
3/4 c chopped nuts (optional see my note in the instructions)

Instructions Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

The recipe says to STIR in M&Ms and nuts at this point. I always put
the M&Ms right in the mixer. I suppose a couple might get broken but
if they are it hasn't caused any serious issues and doing it this way
is easy and fast. My boys have never taken nuts to school because of
children with allergies and, as a result, have gotten used to their
cookies without them. Therefore, we always skip the nuts. That's a
matter of personal choice. Using teaspoons, drop cookies of about one
heaping teaspoon onto your cookie sheets, making them about two inches
apart. My cookie sheets need to be greased. Bake for between 10 and 13
minutes. I prefer mine cooked less rather than more. Another personal
choice but don't overcook them.Cool on wire cookie racks. Enjoy!
