This printable recipe makes about 50 cookies.

Serves:

Prep Time:

Total Time: Ingredients

1 cup (2 sticks) of soft butter (it is critical that it be soft)
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup packed light brown sugar
1 large egg
1 tsp vanilla
2 cups regular all-purpose flour (240 g)
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/8 tsp salt
12-ounce package of M&Ms (see my secret in the box near the end of the page)
3/4 c chopped nuts (optional see my note in the instructions)

Instructions Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
1. In a mixing bowl, cream together the butter and the sugars until
light and fluffy. It is critical that the butter be at room
temperature in order to make this step work nicely. [BAT: I've done it
with cold butter and it was fine, just took a little longer]

2. Beat in the egg and the vanilla.

3. In another bowl, mix together flour, baking soda and salt.

4. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix.

5. The recipe says to STIR in M&Ms and nuts at this point. I always
put the M&Ms right in the mixer. I suppose a couple might get broken
but if they are it hasn't caused any serious issues and doing it this
way is easy and fast. My boys have never taken nuts to school because
of children with allergies and, as a result, have gotten used to their
cookies without them. Therefore, we always skip the nuts. That's a
matter of personal choice.

6. Using teaspoons [not the measuring kind], drop cookies of about one
heaping teaspoon onto parchment-lined cookie sheets, making them about
two inches apart. Be aware that making these cookies too big causes
them to spread out and become flat.

7. Bake for between 10 and 13 minutes. I prefer mine cooked less rather than more. Another personal choice but don't overcook them.

8. Cool on wire cookie racks.
