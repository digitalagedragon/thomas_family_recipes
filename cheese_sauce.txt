Modernist:


11g sodium citrate
265g water or milk
285g shredded cheese


Whisk together the sodium citrate and liquid, and bring to a simmer. 
Add the cheese gradually, blending each addition with an immersion blender until completely smooth.


UPDATE:
Good enough to whisk together the sodium citrate and liquid, then add 285g cheese as a block. Let it basically melt, then hit it with the stick blender.
