1/4 C chicken broth
1 Tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt
4 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 lbs string beans or Chinese long beans
2 Tbsp minced (fresh) ginger
2 oz ground pork (about 1/4 Cup)
1 Tbsp Chinkiang or balsamic vinegar
1 tsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp chopped scallion

In a bowl combine the broth, sugar, and salt.

Heat a 14-inch flat-bottomed wok over high heat until a bead of water
vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact. Swirl in 2 Tbsp of the
vegetable oil and add half the beans. Reduce the heat to medium and
pan-fry, turning the beans with a metal spatula, until they have brown
spots and begin to wrinkle, 3 - 4 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a
slotted spoon. Pan-fry the remaining beans with 1 Tbsp of the vegetable
oil in the same manner.

If the unwashed wok is dry, swirl in the remaining 1 Tbsp vegetable
oil over medium heat. Add the ginger and ground pork and stir-fry until
the pork is no longer pink, breaking up the pork with a spatula, about 1
minute. Stir the broth mixture and swirl it into the wok. Bring to a boil
over high heat and add the beans, tossing to combine, and cook until most
of the liquid has evaporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the vinegar, sesame
oil, and scallion, and remove from the heat. Serve at room temperature.
Serves 4 as part of a multicourse meal.
