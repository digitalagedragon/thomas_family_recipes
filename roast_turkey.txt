Thoughts after making: I update the recipe with many of the lessons learned, but want to note I didn't do anything at all with the juices in the roasting pan because I'd only used 1C deglazing liquid in the bottom of the pan, and it ran out while the turkey was still early in its roast (I also ran the oven at 450 convection), so things burned pretty badly there. The Jus seemed to turn out just fine (though forgot the soy sauce and had to put in a couple of pinches of salt at the end). So still see what you can do with the drippings next year but I have no direct advice for you (me).




Turkey:
1 turkey, not frozen, about 12 lbs
2 Tbsp salt
1 tsp ground black pepper
1 celery stalk
1 medium carrot
1 medium onion
1 onion worth of mirepoix
2 branches sage

2 branches thyme
1 1/2C Deglazing liquid (good white wine, or apple cider, or...the first time I made this (Thanksgiving, 2018), I used Veuve Cliquot and it was amazing)


Jus:
1 Tbsp oil
Neck, giblets and wing tips from one turkey (don't use the liver)
2 carrots, peeled and cut into 2 or 3 pieces
3 celery stalks, cut into thirds
1 large onion, peeled and quartered
1 tsp salt
ground pepper
1 1/2 C de-glazing liquid from above
4 C chicken broth
A few sage leaves and 2 sprigs fresh thyme
1 clove of garlic, smashed and peeled
1 tsp soy sauce



End-to-end this recipe takes twenty-four or more hours.




Set oven to convection roast at 420 degrees F

Remove and discard the gizzards. Cut off the wing tips with a poultry shears. Remove the neck. Reserve them for the jus.

Sprinkle half the salt into the cavity, and rub the other half over the bird.


Chop the celery and carrots into large pieces, and peel and halve the onion. Push them inside the cavity, with the herbs.

Add 1 1/2 C de-glazing liquid to the bottom of the pan. Roast the turkey for 1 hour at 420 degrees F. Then, without removing the bird, drop the oven temperature to non-convection bake at 170 degrees F, and roast it at least one hour per pound. It will not overcook or cause problems to hold it for up to 72 hours. The internal temperature goal is probably around 145F but it may be difficult to keep it under 155F; anything over 140F for at least a couple of hours is fine.

You may make the stock for jus immediately and refrigerate it for reheating the next day, or set the components in the fridge and make it 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 hours before before you serve the turkey. To make the stock:


Turn a burner to medium high. Add oil when pan is hot, add the neck, other turkey parts and mirepoix. Allow everything to brown, stirring now and again to prevent scorching, about 10 minutes.

Add 1 cup of the de-glazing liquid and scrape up the browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Add chicken broth, garlic, herbs and soy sauce. Stir and bring to a boil, then immediately turn down the heat to a simmer. Partly cover and let simmer gently for at least an hour and no more than two. Strain the stock and set aside. You should have about 3 cups.

When the turkey is done, remove it to a platter or cutting board and tent with foil. Set the roasting pan across two burners. Over medium-high heat, get the juices bubbling hot and then add the remaining 1/2C of de-glazing liquid, scraping up the bits that stuck to the pan. Let cook for another for another two minutes until some of the liquid has evaporated. Add the stock from step 8 and cook, stirring occasionally, for another 5 or 6 minutes, until it has reduced slightly. Taste and adjust for seasoning. Strain to remove any remaining solids, put back into a pot and keep hot.


Won't this leave fat sitting on top? Perhaps skim fat first and bind with flour, or add some xantham gum and stick-blend the final product to bind it?


Serve!
