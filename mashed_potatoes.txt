2 lbs Yukon Gold (or Russet) potatoes, scrubbed
8 Tbsp (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted
1 C 
half-and-half
&nbsp;
1 1/2 tsp salt
Ground black pepper




Place potatoes in a large saucepan with cold water to cover by about 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender when pricked with a thin-bladed knife, 20 - 30 minutes. Drain the potatoes.

Set a ricer over the now-empty but still-warm saucepan. Cut each potato in half (skin-on) and place in the ricer, cut-side down. Press down the ricer, and the potato will be forced out, leaving behind the half-skin to be discarded. Repeat for all halves and potatoes.

Stir in the melted butter with a wooden spoon until incorporated. Gently whisk in the half-and-half, salt, and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.


Variation: May also add previously-roasted garlic cloves to the ricer with the potatoes for garlic mashed potatoes.
