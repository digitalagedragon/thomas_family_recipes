Made for Christmas dinner, was excellent - the Granny Smiths are
very tart, but the sugar balances it nicely. I also tossed in a pinch
of fresh-ground nutmeg, a teaspoon of ground cinnamon, and coated the
bottom pie crust with an egg white (per suggestion in the comments).

1 recipe pastry for a 9 inch double crust pie
1/2 cup unsalted butter
3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1/4 cup water
1/2 cup white sugar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter in a
saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar and
brown sugar, and bring to a boil. Reduce temperature and let simmer.

Place the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded
slightly. Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and
butter liquid over the crust. Pour slowly so that it does not run off.

Bake 15 minutes in the preheated oven. Reduce the temperature to 350
degrees F (175 degrees C). Continue baking for 35 to 45 minutes, until
apples are soft.
