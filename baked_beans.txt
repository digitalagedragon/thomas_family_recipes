Start with homemade bbq sauce.

Preheat oven to 400.

Take four pieces of thick-cut bacon, and put them in a frying pan,
and cook for ten minutes at 400 in the skillet.

Remove the bacon and set it aside.

Dice one onion and 1/4 of a green pepper. Saute in the pan in the grease
from the bacon until onion is translucent. Add in four chopped garlic
cloves, 1 25 oz can of pinto beans, 3/4 C of bbq sauce and 2 Tbsp of
Dijon mustard. Bring to a simmer.

Pour the bean mixture into a small baking pan, and cover with the four
pieces of bacon. Bake at 325 for two hours.
