450g all-purpose flour
3g sea salt
4g baking soda, sifted
1.5C buttermilk (or 22g champagne vinegar and 338g whole milk, let
                 stand five minutes before using)

Preheat oven to 450 degrees.

In a large bowl, mix together the flour, salt and baking soda. Make a
well in the center and pour in the milk. Using your hand, mix in the
flour from the sides of the bowl. The dough should be soft but not wet
and sticky.

Turn the dough out onto a well-floured work surface. Wash and dry your
hands. Knead the dough lightly for a few seconds, then pat the dough
into a round about 1 1/2 inches thick. Place it on a buttered (or
Silpatted) baking sheet and using a sharp knife, cut a deep cross in
the center of the dough reaching out all the way to the sides.

Bake for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 400 degrees,
and continue to bake until the top is golden brown and the bottom of
the bread sounds hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes longer. Serve
warm.
