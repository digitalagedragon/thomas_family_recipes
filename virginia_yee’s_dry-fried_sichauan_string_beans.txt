Sauce:
1/4 C chicken broth
1 Tbsp sugar
1 tsp salt


4 Tbsp oil (for wok)
1 lbs string beans or Chinese long beans
2 Tbsp minced ginger
2 ounces ground pork (about 1/4 C)
1 Tbsp Chinkiang vinegar
1 tsp sesame oil
1 Tbsp chopped scallion


1. In a bowl combine the broth, sugar, and salt.


2. Heat the wok. Swirl in 2 Tbsp of the oil and add half the beans. Pan-fry, turning the beans with a spatula, until they have brown spots and begin to wrinkle, 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. Pan-fry the remaining beans with 1 Tbsp of the oil in the same manner. (You can probably cook them all at once over the fire outside).


3. If the unwashed wok is dry, swirl in the remaining 1 Tbsp oil. Add the ginger and ground pork and stir-fry until the pork is no longer pink, breaking up the pork with a spatula, about 1 minute. Stir the broth mixture and swirl it into the wok. Bring to a boil and add the beans, tossing to combine, and cook until most of the liquid has evaported, 1 - 2 minutes. Ad the vinegar, sesame oil, and scallion and remove from the heat. Serve at room temperature.
