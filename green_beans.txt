1 1/4 lbs of green beans, washed and trimmed
1/2 a small onion
1/2 C sliced raw almonds
1/2 tsp salt
1C red wine
6 cloves garlic, chopped
4C chicken broth (guessing)
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar


Toast the almonds by putting them in a saute pan with 1 Tbsp of
butter.  Keep them moving, and keep an eye on them - they go from raw
to cooked in about minute.


Sweat the onions in butter in a large, deep frying pan.  Add the
garlic as they get close to done.


When onions are soft, translucent and starting to brown, add the salt,
broth, and vinegar. Bring to a boil.  Add green beans, and cook 8-10
minutes or until desired doneness.


Remove the green beans, and drain off all but about 1C of liquid.  Add
red wine, and return to a boil.  Add flour or cornstarch to thicken
sauce.


Toss the grean beans, the almonds and the sauce, and serve.

Made above with a lot of differences; this is my attempt at 


Notes, 12/29/08:
I did 3 of broth (homemade turkey broth from Thanksgiving).  I put in
a *ton* of flour to thicken it; too much.  There was also too much
sauce relative to the beans.  Next year I'd think no more than 2C of
broth - maybe 1.


Notes, 12/26/09:
Did about 1C of chicken broth (canned, all I had).  It thickened up
with about 1 1/2 tsp of flour, but there wasn't enough of it.  I think
2C might be a sweet spot.  Also, the beans had a slightly "boiled"
taste to them - I'm wondering whether it doesn't make sense to steam
them first, then throw them in the pan with the sauce while it
thickens.
