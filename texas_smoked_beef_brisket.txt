20130815: Tried 1 tbsp pepper, 1 tsp chili, 1 tbsp salt - was still a bit too salty. Try 1.5 tsp salt next time. Also, on a 2.5 pound brisket, don't use all of it. Cooked 'til 175 in the smoker at 300, and it was a *little* tough but not bad. Next time could go 'til 180.


20120902: Rub below (3 tbsp pepper, 2 tsp chili, 1 tsp cayenne, 2tbsp salt) was *way* too peppery and a little too salty.
