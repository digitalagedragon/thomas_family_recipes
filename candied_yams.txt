Also known as sweet potatoes with marshmallows.


2 22oz packages pre-chopped yams
2/3 C brown sugar (light or dark)
2 sticks butter
1 tsp ground cinnamon
1/2 tsp salt
Fresh ground nutmeg
1 tsp vanilla extract
Bag of miniature marshmellows




Preheat oven to 375F.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Add the yams to a large mixing bowl.

In a saucepan, melt the butter. Then, add brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and vanilla extract. Stir until combined.


Toss the yams and sauce in the mixing bowl, then pour onto the baking sheet.

Bake for 30 minutes at 375. (Thirty? I think? Verify, the yams should be soft).

Remove from the oven, and increase the temperature to 450F.

Place the yams and sauce in a greased like 9" - 12" casserole dish. Mash them with a fork or potato masher. Cover with miniature marshmallows.

Bake at 450 for 3 - 5 minutes, or until the marshmallows are partially melted and golden brown.
