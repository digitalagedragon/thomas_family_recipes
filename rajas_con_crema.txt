6 fresh poblano chiles

1 Tbsp butter 1/2 white onion, sliced lengthwise (root to tip), 1/4-inch
slices 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/2 cup Mexcian crema (Mexican sour cream)
or crème fraîche 1/2 cup milk 1/2 cup grated Monterey Jack cheese METHOD




1 Char the whole poblano chile peppers on all sides. The best way to
do this is over an open flame of a gas stove. Just place the raw whole
chile peppers directly on the grate covering the flame and let the flame
blacken the outside skin of the peppers. When one side has blackened,
use tongs to turn the chile over a little so the flame can blacken another
side. You can also use a broiler to blacken the chile peppers, but direct
flame is the best way. Sometimes with a broiler the chiles end up cooking
too much before they blacken. They should still be a little firm. This
is easier to control when you cook them directly over flame. Once the
peppers are blackened all over (you can still have a few green spots),
place them in a paper bag or a thick plastic bag, close the bag, and
let the chiles steam in their own heat for a few minutes.


2 When the chiles are cool to touch, remove them from the bag. Working
over a sink (this part is messy) use your fingers or a damp towel to
strip off the blackened parts. Try to avoid running the chiles themselves
under water, as that may wash away some good flavor. But you may find it
easier to rinse your hands with water as you are stripping the blackened
bits off.


3 Once the blackened outer skin is removed, open up the chiles and cut
out and discard the stems, seeds, and inner veins. Cut the chiles into
long strips, about an inch wide. Many recipes call for thin strips,
about a half inch wide, which you can do if you want. I just like them
with thicker strips. Set aside.


4 Heat the butter (can use vegetable oil instead if you want) in a
large cast iron skillet on medium heat. Add the onions and cook until
translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.








5 Add the poblano chiles to the onions. Sprinkle the chiles with salt. Add
the Mexican crema and the milk. Gently stir to coat the chiles. Let cook
for several minutes, until the chiles are completely cooked through and
the sauce is bubbly and a little reduced, then sprinkle in the grated
jack cheese. Stir with the hot crema sauce until the cheese has melted
and mixed in with the crema sauce.
