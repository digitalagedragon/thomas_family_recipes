20180402: Made it in the new (650 Elm) house in the upper oven and the
meatballs fell apart and were still raw inside. Try fifteen minutes next
time (unless I’ve divined that the oven is cold)

1 small onion, liquified (with handy-chopper, or similar) 2 slices
sandwich bread, town into quarters 1/3 C whole milk
8 garlic cloves, minced 1/2 C (20g) grated parmesan cheese
1/4 C (5g) minced fresh parsley

1 tsp dried or 1 Tbsp fresh oregano, minced
3/4 tsp salt
1/4 tsp red pepper
2 large eggs 1 1/4 lbs 85% lean ground beef 4 oz Italian sausage

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees.

Liquify the onion. Place the sandwich bread, milk, and onion liquid in
a medium bowl and mash with a fork until combined. Combine all other
ingredients in bowl. Roll about 16 1 1/2" meatballs from this mixture,
and place on a rack on a rimmed baking sheet (fat will render off). Bake
at 425 for 10 minutes.

Pasta is 50g dry / person
