20191202 - These are so dense they made my mixer smoke. Find a lighter recpie?

20120303 - Stuck to bottom of mixing bowl last time I made it; trying
increasing flour by 20G to 410 G.

2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
1 C milk
1 Tbsp vinegar
2 Tbsp honey
1 1/2 tsp salt
410 grams (3 C) grams bread flour
3 Tbsp butter, melted

Heat milk to 110 degrees F (1:10 in my microwave out of the
fridge). Mix yeast into milk and let sit for ten minutes.

While that activates, put all the other ingredients (vinegar, honey,
salt, butter and flour) into the mixing bowl.

When the yeast is active, add to the mixing bowl and mix for three minutes
with the bread hook. Let rest five minutes, and then mix for three more
minutes with the bread hook.

Place the dough ball in an oiled bowl and cover with plastic wrap and
place in a warm spot until the dough has doubled in size, usually about
90 minutes

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide into 12
pieces. Roll the pieces into balls and place them on a baking sheet
with parchment paper or silicone sheet on it. Allow the rolls to rise
another 20 minutes.

Brush the rolls with melted butter and bake at 400 degrees until golden
brown (about 20 minutes).
