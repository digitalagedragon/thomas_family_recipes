1 sm. onion, chopped
1 head of garlic (12 cloves), chopped
4 28 oz cans of low salt chopped tomatoes
some pepper :)
1 Tbsp balsamic vinegar
1 1/2 tsp dried oregano
~1/2C fresh chopped basil (or, 3 Tbsp of dried)
2 bay leaves
1C red wine
1 tsp sugar salt

Sautee the onion and until the onion is translucent, in olive oil. Add
the garlic and cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add the chopped
tomatoes to the pot. Add the vinegar, oregano, bay leaves, red wine,
and basil (if dried) to pot and simmer for six hours. Add the basil
(if fresh) and 1stp of sugar (or more or less to taste) and serve.

Notes:

20151110 If making in the slow cooker, cook on high for 8 hours, and
drain 2 of the cans of tomatoes, first.

20071223 I also added about 3/4C of water, and the sauce was too thin
(had to boil it down). Had to also add a little salt, so maybe next
time use only one can of low salt tomatoes? Also, replace the chopped
tomatoes with pureed ones to keep from dirtying the food processor.

I thought it was a bit acidic, so I added about 1/2 tsp of sugar
towards the end.

20090218 Made it in Bear Vally. I added the sugar early in the
cooking. The result was very acidic, but there were two odd
variables - Betsy turned it down, early, so it may have simmered
as little as four hours - and, the high altitude (7k feet) meant it
probably wanted to cook even longer, anyway.


20100409 Don't use pureed tomatoes, they're too acidic. Added 2 tsp
of sugar at the end and it's pretty good.
