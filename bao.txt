1 1/2 C (360 ml) whole milk
1/2 C (120 ml) heavy cream
1/2 C (100 g) granulated sugar, divided in half
5 large egg yolks
1/4 C (38 g) cornstarch
1/4 C (57 g) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
1 1/2 tsp (8 ml) pure vanilla extract

Add the milk and cream in a medium-size saucepan. Bring to a simmer
over medium heat. Whisk in 1‚ÅÑ4 cup sugar until dissolved and then turn
off the heat.

In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/4 C sugar
until smooth.

Add the cornstarch to the egg mixture and whisk until incorporated.

Remove the simmering milk mixture from the heat. Measure 1/4 C of it,
then gradually add it to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to
temper. Gradually add the tempered egg mixture to the remaining milk
mixture, whisking constantly.

Place the saucepan on the stove, heat over medium-high heat. Whisk
constantly until the mixture slightly thickens, 3 minutes. Turn off
the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove.

Whisk in the cold butter and vanilla until incorporated. Cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 2
hours. The custard can be made a day in advance.
