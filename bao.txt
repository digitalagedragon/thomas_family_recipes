https://www.chinasichuanfood.com/chinese-bbq-pork-buns/

300 g all purpose flour + more for dusting
40 g sugar
2 tsp. sugar tolerant instant yeast
160 g warm water
1 Tbsp neutral oil
a tiny pinch of salt

In a stand mixer, place all of the dough ingredients in and then knead
for 7-9 minutes at slow speed. Then cover and rest for 10 to 15
minutes.

Slightly re-knead the dough for another 2 minutes until the smooth
becomes very smooth. Shape into long log first and then divide the
dough into 12 equal portions. Re-knead each wrapper dough until the
surface becomes smooth.

Roll each of the wrapper dough into a round wrapper around 10 cm (4
in) in diameter with thin edges. Scoop around 1 tablespoon of filling
in the center and seal the buns completely. Repeat to finish all of
the buns.

Place the buns on baking papers. Cover and let rest for 20 minutes at
room temperature.

Steam buns for 15 minutes, let rest 5 minutes before serving.

To reheat, steam for 5 minutes.

BBQ Pork Filling:
Makes enough for 12 buns

In theory the start to this should be 2 cups of leftover char siu
dices. In reality it's probably not worth making them to start with,
so I've just used quickly browned diced pork of some kind.

2 C diced cooked pork (char siu ideally)
100 ml cold water
1 Tbsp cornstarch
1 Tbsp light soy sauce
1 Tbsp oyster sauce
1 Tbsp hoisin sauce
1 Tbsp sugar

Mix the cornstarch and water in in a small saucepan, and let rest for
2 minutes until completely combined.

Add cornstarch, soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, and sugar to
saucepan. Heat over low heat until there are big bubbles.

Remove from heat, add the pork, stir to combine. Let cool in fridge
covered for 30 minutes before using in buns.

Custard:
Makes enough for 24 buns
https://www.jessicagavin.com/chinese-steamed-custard-bun-recipe/

1 1/2 C (360 ml) whole milk
1/2 C (120 ml) heavy cream
1/2 C (100 g) granulated sugar, divided in half
5 large egg yolks
1/4 C (38 g) cornstarch
1/4 C (57 g) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
1 1/2 tsp (8 ml) pure vanilla extract

Add the milk and cream in a medium-size saucepan. Bring to a simmer
over medium heat. Whisk in 1‚ÅÑ4 cup sugar until dissolved and then turn
off the heat.

In a medium-size bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and 1/4 C sugar
until smooth.

Add the cornstarch to the egg mixture and whisk until incorporated.

Remove the simmering milk mixture from the heat. Measure 1/4 C of it,
then gradually add it to the egg mixture, whisking constantly to
temper. Gradually add the tempered egg mixture to the remaining milk
mixture, whisking constantly.

Place the saucepan on the stove, heat over medium-high heat. Whisk
constantly until the mixture slightly thickens, 3 minutes. Turn off
the heat and remove the saucepan from the stove.

Whisk in the cold butter and vanilla until incorporated. Cover with
plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled and set, at least 2
hours. The custard can be made a day in advance.
