Sesame Dipping Sauce:


    * 6 Tbsp white sesame seeds     * 3 Tbsp mirin     * 1 Tbsp
sugar     * 1 Tbsp vinegar     * 2 and 1/2 Tbsp soysauce     *
1/2 tsp grated garlic     * 1/2 cup dashi soup


Grind sesame seeds well. Pour mirin gradually over the sesame seeds,
mixing together. Add sugar, vinegar, and soy sauce in the sauce. Further,
add grated garlic and mix well. Pour dashi stock gradually, stirring well.


*Makes 4 servings


Kombu Dashi: 2 C water 1 4" square of kombu, wiped clean (not washed)
Soak kombu in the water for 30 minutes, then bring the water to a
boil.  Just before the water boils, remove the kombu.


Ponzu Sauce:


    * 1/3 cup soy sauce     * 1/4 cup lemon juice     * 1
Tbsp. rice wine vinegar     * 1/3 cup dashi soup


I found this to be WAY too lemony with fresh lemon juice (was juice of
one lemon).  Half as much, maybe.


The Shabu Shabu itself I made with two NY strip steaks, carrots, Chinese
cabbage, scallions and shitake mushrooms (which Betsy apparently hates).
