1 lbs carrots, peeled and sliced
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp sugar
1 Tbsp butter
1 bay leaf
1 sprig fresh thyme (or one shake of dried)
2 garlic cloves, smashed


Sous Vide:
Put everything in a bag, vacuum seal it, and cook at 185 for 1 hour.
At serving time, place in a skillet and cook until the liquid is reduced, there is a glaze, and the carrots are beginning to brown.


Stovetop:
Put everything but the butter and sugar in a pan, and cover the bottom with water or chicken stock (about 1/2 C)
Bring to a boil, then cook covered on medium for 5 minutes. Remove the lid, then cook until the liquid boils off. Add sugar and butter, and toss to coat. Serve immediately.
