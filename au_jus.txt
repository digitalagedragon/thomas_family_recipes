1 Mirepoix Mix Box
1 Tbsp tomato paste (for umami)
3C Beef Broth

Roast the roast. After the roast is resting, bring the roasting pan up
on top of the stove. If there's a lot of fat in the pan (more than about
1/8 C) pour most of it off, but be sure not to lose any meat juices. If
necessary, on the convex, add some high-heat oil to the pan if it's dry.

Add the mirepoix, and cook over medium high heat until the mirepoix is
browned and sticking to the bottom of the pan, about seven minutes.

Pour in the stock and deglaze the pan. Transfer to a stock pot, and
simmer until liquid has reduced to about 2/3 of its original volume,
about 20 minutes.

Strain the liquid, and serve.
