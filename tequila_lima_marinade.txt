Via Jeff, who made it with a flank steak for us when we went up to see
the Blue Angles during Fleet Week '07.


1/2 cup fresh lime juice
2 teaspoons grated lime peel
7 garlic cloves, finely chopped
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (or 3 Tbsp dried)
2 teaspoons ground cumin
2 teaspoons dried oregano
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup olive oil
1/3 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup tequila
2 2-pound beef loin tri-tip roasts, trimmed


I used flank steak, as well, marinated for 1 hour, was delicious.
Only cooked for about 6 minutes, should've been about 10.


Skirt steak takes about 6 minutes, it's really thin.


I'm trying tri-tip at about 20 minutes on the theory it's about as
thick as a London Broil on the thick side.

Tequila I used was the gold nice thing.
