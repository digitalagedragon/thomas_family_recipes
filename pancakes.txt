2/3 by weight

164 grams white flour
154 grams whole wear flour
12 grams sugar
6 grams baking powder
4 grams baking soda
4 grams salt
2 Tbsp melted butter
2 Eggs
2 C buttermilk

1/3:

82 g white flour
77 g wheat flour
1 tsp sugar
1/2 tsp baking powder
1/4 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp salt
1 Tbsp melted butter
1 egg 1 C buttermilk

2/3:
2 C flour
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
1/4 tsp+ salt
2 Tbsp melted butter
2 eggs
2 C buttermilk

Original:

3 C flour
1 tbsp sugar
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp baking soda
1/2 tsp salt
3 tbsp melted butter
3 eggs
3 C buttermilk

Combine the dry ingredients, and mix well.

Beat the eggs. Melt the butter. Mix the butter into the eggs. Add the
buttermilk to the wet ingredients.

Mix all the wet into the dry, stirring vigorously and for as short a
period of time as possible.

To make egg nog pancakes, replace the buttermilk with egg nog, drop the
baking soda and add 1 1/4 tsp sesame oil.

20101205:  Made egg-nog pancakes with 1/2 egg-nog and 1/2 buttermilk,
came out much fluffier.  Did 1/2 tsp of sesame oil : 1 C liquid. Also
added 1/8 tsp nutmeg : 1 C liquid.  Was a little on the dry side -
perhaps an additional tablespoon of butter?

20101212:  Made egg-nog pancakes with all egg-nog. For each 1 C of
liquid, put in 1 Tbsp of vinegar and 15 Tbsp of egg-nog.  Also added
1/8 tsp cinnamon : 1 C liquid.  Think it might like a *little* more
sesame oil.  Also added 1 extra Tbsp of melted butter, as they'd
seemed dry last time.

For oatmeal pancakes, 2:1 oatmeal for 1/4 the flour.  So, for example,
if making 1C white and 1C whole wheat, do .5C whole wheat and 1C
oatmeal.  Soak the oatmeal in the buttermilk overnight, the night
before.  Did this 20080217, was just a *tad* dry, might do 1/3C whole
wheat.
