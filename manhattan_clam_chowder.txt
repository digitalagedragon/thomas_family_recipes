20131224: This is too much since most people don’t like it. Cut everything but clams and bacon in half (so, 2 C chicken broth; 15 oz tomatoes). Also, at that strength, two cloves of garlic.





First try, 20101224, I'm doubling and ideally trying fresh clams.

2 slices of bacon, cooked until crisp

1/2 large sweet onion, diced

2 carrots, diced

2 celery stalks, diced

1 clove of garlic, minced

4 cups of chicken broth

1-2 15 oz cans of diced tomatoes, blended with an immersion blender

1/2 tsp crushed red pepper

1-2 tsp dried thyme

1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce

1 bay leaf

Sea salt and freshly cracked pepper, to taste (1 tsp salt)

6-7 red baby potatoes, diced into bite sized chunks

2 6.5 oz cans of clams and the juice





Cook the bacon in a large Dutch oven over medium heat. Once crispy, remove from pan and place on a paper towel to drain the fat. Once cooled, crumble the bacon. Remove all but 2 tsp of bacon grease from the Dutch oven. Add the onion, celery and carrots to the Dutch oven and sauté for 6-7 minutes or until soft and tender. Add the minced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 60 seconds.
