2 *ripe* avocados
1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt if no jalapeño, 1/2 tsp with
Juice of one half lime
1/4 white onion, diced
2 cloves garlic, diced
1 jalapeño pepper, diced
2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped
A dash of freshly grated black pepper
1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped


Mash the avocados with a fork. Add the salt and lime juice, and mix, then add the other ingredients. Serve immediately, or cover with plastic and refrigerate. Don’t get clever and add the lime juice before you mash the avocado, because then the avocado will just squirt around instead of mashing.
