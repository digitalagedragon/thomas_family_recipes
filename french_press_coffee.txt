20190401: I now use 25g coffee : 300g water

20160811: 20g was better, but I ground it fine. Was a little bitter,
but a lot stronger.

20160810: 15g seemed a bit weak. Perhaps 20g?

One mug of coffee is 225g of water, and 15g of coffee.


Add 15g/mug of coarse-ground coffee to the French Press Heat water to 205
degrees F.  Add water to French Press.  Wait 30 - 45 seconds, and stir.
Wait 6 minutes, and plunge.
