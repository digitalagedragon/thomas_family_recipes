Can substitute 32 oz frozen raw chopped clams. If you do so, add them
with the potatoes and boil for ten minutes.


Wondra makes a great flour for this.


If using clam juice, recommend just 8 oz, 16 ozs was very
clammy. Substitute chicken stock for the other 8 oz (and the water)


--- 4 cans minced clams 16 oz clam juice (or chicken stock) 1 C water 4
slices (about 4 oz) thick-cut bacon, cut into 1/4 inch pieces 1 large
spanish onion, chopped medium 2 Tbsp all-purpose flour 1 1/2 lbs red
potatoes (about 3 medium) scrubbed and cut into 1/2 inch dice 1 large
bay leaf 1 tsp minced fresh thyme or 1/4 tsp dried


1 C heavy cream 2 Tbsp minced fresh parsley leaves Salt and Pepper


Open and drain the clams, reserving the juice into a large mixing
bowl. Add the clam juice and 1 C of water to this bowl.


Fry the bacon in in a stockpot or dutch oven over medium-low heat until
the fat is rendered and the bacon is crisp, 5-7 minutes. Add the onion
and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add
the flour and stir until lightly colored, about 1 minute.  &nbsp;
