minutes.

Gradually whisk in the clam broth and water (and reserved juice if
using canned clams). If using frozen or fresh clams, add them now. Add
the potatoes, bay leaf, and tyme, and simmer until the potatoes are
tender, about 10 minutes.

Add the cream, parsley, and salt (if needed) and pepper to
taste. Bring to a simmer, but do not boil. Remove the pan from the
heat, discard the bay leaf, and serve immediately.
