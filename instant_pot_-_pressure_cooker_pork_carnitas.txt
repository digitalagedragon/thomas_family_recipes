Set pot to sauté on high.

Spray pot with cooking oil spray, and brown the pork on all sides
(approximately 3 minutes per side).

slivers into the pork roast, all over.


Season pork with cumin, sazon, oregano, adobo, and garlic powder,
all over.


Add chicken broth, chipotle peppers, and bay leaves to instant pot.

some of the juices left in the pot for moister pork.
