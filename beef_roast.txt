20101107 Made the below recipe.  Cooked the roast at 170, took almost
exactly four hours.  Unfortunately, the veggies weren't at all done,
so I ran the oven up to 450 and roasted them while the roast rested
(35 minutes, total).


I'd like to try using 1/8C vinegar, next time.  Maybe none.

Marinade from:


http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/ten-clove-garlic-marinade/Detail.aspx


2/3 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce 1/4 cup soy sauce
1/4 cup steak sauce (replaced with red wine vinegar) 1/4 cup water 1
teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper 1/2 yellow onion, minced 10 cloves
garlic, peeled and minced


I substituded 1/4 C red wine vinegar for the steak sauce.


Was *awesome*.  Cooked to 138, would've been a smidge better at 135.


For gravy, I took 2 Tbsp of beef fat from the drippings, and whisked in
1/8C flour.  I then filled it with the non-fat drippings and cooked it

The cross-rib roast I like to cook to an internal
temp of 140.  Marinade, original inspiration from
http://www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1627,154171-235203,00.html


1 1/2 C olive oil 1/4 C Worcestershire sauce 1/3 C white vinegar 3/4 C
soy sauce 1/2 C wine vinegar 2 tsp pepper 2 tsp salt 7 cloves of garlic,
chopped


This was *very* vinegary.  Not bad, but I think I'd like something more
garlicky, so need to keep working on the marinade.  I cooked it to 145
internal, it hit 155 resting, and it was too cooked.  Definitely stop
at 140.  Also, I cooked it at 325, it took about 2 1/2 hours.  Don't
know if slower cooking would make it better (probably).


For the veggies I used three carrots, sliced into quarters and then
chopped into sections, and a bunch of Yukon Gold potatoes.  I tossed
them with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and put on a generous helping
of salt and some dried rosemary.  They were awesome.


Jus:


After you brown the roast in a pan, add 1 Tbsp of butter to it, and
deglaze with a wooden spoon.  Then, add 5 chopped cloves of garlic and
cook until they begin to brown.


Strain the fat into a small saucepan, and get the fat hot.  Whisk in
2 Tbsp of flour to make a roux, and then add 1C of beef broth.  Bring
to a boil; salt and pepper to taste.


This was awesome.

9/12/10 - 2.475 pound sirloin roast.  Marinated nearly four hours in
red wine (~1.5 cups), 8 cloves garlic, two bay leaves, ~1/3C soy cauce
~1/4 C red wine vinegar, chopped fresh rosemary, dried thyme and sage.


Grilled with indirect heat 9/5/10.  2.75 pound Kobe Cross-rib roast.
Put on a store-bought rub, and put in slivered garlic and fresh rosmary
through small cuts in the roast made with a paring knife (maybe six
cloves' worth).


The grill started at 250 with the top vent all the way open.
Unfortunately, I didn't close that down quickly enough and the temp
rose quickly, so the roast cooked for XX minutes.  Towards the end I
got the vent just barely open and had the temp inside down to 170.


Peak temp on the fire was 126; 131 off.  It was very red in the center,
still, and a bit chewy, it definitely wanted to cook longer.
