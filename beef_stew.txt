3 lbs beef chuck roast trimmed and cut into 1 1/2" cubes Canola or olive
oil 1 medium onion chopped coarse 2 stalks celery, diced 7 garlic cloves,
minced or pressed 3 tbs unbleached all-purpose flour 3 C braising liquid
(see below) 2 bay leaves 2 sprigs fresh thyme 2 sprigs fresh rosemary
~12 small potatoes

1 lbs carrots, peeled and sliced 1/4" thick, plus two medium carrots
diced fine 1/3 C minced fresh parsley leaves 1 C frozen peas (optional)
Salt and pepper to taste


Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Rinse, then dry the beef well with paper
towels. Take a large dutch oven, place it on the stovetop and heat
it. Place ~ 1tbsp of oil in it, and add beef to brown. Don't let the beef
cubes touch; they should remain at least 1/4" apart so that they will
brown instead of braising. Brown on every side for 2-3 minutes. It's
crucial to brown well here, don't worry if the bottom of the pot turns
almost black and the pieces almost look burned - much of the great beefy
stew flavor comes from this step. When the meat is browned, remove it
(pro tip: turn the dutch oven lid upside down and use it as a dish at
this step to avoid dirtying a plate). Add more oil if needed, and brown
the beef in batches until complete. This step is the most labor-intensive
and usually takes about half an hour.


If needed, place another tablespoon of oil in the dutch oven, and
add the onion, celery and diced carrots. Cook, stirring frequently
and vigorously with a wooden spoon. Be sure to scrape the pot bottom
here to get all the browned bits from the beef up. Do this until the
onions are soft, 4 - 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant,
about 30 seconds. Stir in the flour, and cook until lightly colored, 1-2
minutes. Add braising liquid, and bring to a simmer. Scrape the bottom
and sides of the dutch oven with the spoon to make sure you've gotten all
the browned bits up. Add the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme, browned beef,
and return to a simmer. Cover and place in the oven. Cook for one hour.


Remove the pot from the oven and put in the potatoes and carrots. Cover
and return to oven; cook until beef is just tender, about one hour.


Optional step: If you prefer a thicker sauce, remove everything but the
sauce from the dutch oven. Adding 1/4 C brandy here to the sauce makes
for a great rich flavor. Return the dutch oven with sauce to the stove
and boil uncovered until the sauce thickens to the desired point. Then,
return all the stew ingredients to the pot, and toss to coat.


Remove the bay leaves and whatever is left of the thyme and rosemary
stems. If you like peas in your stew, put in 1 C of frozen peas,
previously thawed, and let it sit for 5 minutes.


Salt and pepper to taste, and serve (or cool and put in the fridge to
reheat later)


Braising Liquid: The original recipe calls for 1C of dry red wine and 2C
of chicken stock. I've also used dark beer (Guinness). Beef stock is an
obvious substitute for the chicken, but only home-made (not store-bought,
which tends to be terrible).Â
