4 g ground aromatics
90g 151 proof alcohol

(Total untared weight of the mason jar and contents should be
300g. Thinking it through the 90g is probably a little low because I
think in my second measurement I measured the weight of the lid as well
as the jar).

Place in half-pint mason jar and cook at 165F for 12 hours

Strain the result. Filter through a dust mask.

Should produce approximately 88ccs of final product, or roughly two shots.
