First time I made this, in the 1041 Sunset Drive oven, 45 minutes was insufficient. The butter melting takes 1:30, then let it sit a bit




45 minutes was way too short in a white pan. Checked at 50 and it was still very wet. Next time try 60 before you open it.





Ingredients

Soft butter, for greasing the pan
Flour, for dusting the buttered pan
4 large eggs
1 cup (201 g) sugar, sifted
1 cup (220 g) brown sugar, sifted
8 ounces melted butter
11/4 cups (55 g) cocoa, sifted
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
1/2 cup (60 g) flour, sifted
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt


Directions

Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F. Butter and flour an 8-inch square pan.
In a mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the eggs at medium speed until fluffy and light yellow. Add both sugars. Add remaining ingredients, and mix to combine.

Pour the batter into a greased and floured 8-inch square pan and bake for 45 minutes. Check for doneness with the tried-and-true toothpick method: a toothpick inserted into the center of the pan should come out clean. When it's done, remove to a rack to cool. Resist the temptation to cut into it until it's mostly cool.
