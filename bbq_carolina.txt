There are four things that need to happen in this process. There are a
number of options on how to proceed with them. Those four things are:

1) Make BBQ Sauce
2) Make Slaw
3) Cook the pork
4) Smoke the pork (may be done at the same time as #3)

In order:

BBQ SAUCE
This is a "Piedmont" or "Lexington" sauce. It is very thin, vinegary,
and has a little of tomato in it for color and flavor (from
ketchup). This yields about two cups, which is enough to make the slaw
later in this recipe, and to use as the liquid in a pressure cooker if
you're making it this way. You may wish to double up the sauce recipe
so you have more to put on the finished product; it keeps basically
forever since it's mostly vinegar.

1-1/2 cups distilled white or cider vinegar 320 g (I prefer cider)
10 tablespoons (200g) tomato ketchup
Salt to taste, if desired
1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper
Pinch of crushed hot red pepper flakes
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup water
Freshly ground pepper to taste

Put everything in a pot and bring it briefly to a boil and stir to
combine. If you want to get fancy, you could hit it with a stick
blender to dissolve all the ketchup solids. Let cool.

SLAW
This is *not* Cole slaw, which has things like mayonnaise and raisins
in it. It's just slaw, or maybe "red slaw" or "BBQ slaw" if you want
to get all specific.

1 lbs shredded cabbage
1 C BBQ Sauce, above

Stir to combine, chill. Better if made a day or more in advance to let
the flavors combine.

COOKING THE PORK
There are four basic options here for how to do it. The first is the
hardest: Get a real smoker, rub the pork with salt, hickory smoke it
for at least 18 hours. If you don't know how to do that, I'm not going
to explain it here.

The second way is sous vide: Cook the pork at 160F for 18 - 72 (!)
hours, then see smoking instructions, below. If you have the ability
to salt it before you sous vide it, that's great, and you
should. Otherwise, you'll need to liberally salt the final
result. (You may not be able to do this because if you're making a
full 7 lbs shoulder, you probably can't re-vacuum seal it before you
cook it).

The third way is pressure cooking it. In this case, get a boneless
half-shoulder (2.25 - 3.5 lbs generally). Rub it with salt. Place 1C
of the BBQ SAUCE in the pressure cooker, then the shoulder, fat side
up (if you do it the other way around, you'll wash all the salt
off). Cook it on high pressure for 80 minutes, and then allow for a
natural pressure release (generally about 25 more minutes).

The final way is to cook it in an oven. You want to bring it to an
internal temperature of 160F and hold it there for a long time (18
hours). If your oven goes down to 170, you could probably put it in
the oven for 18 hours. I've never tried it and you should use a
thermometer to ensure you hit the target temperature.

SMOKING THE PORK
If you cooked the pork by smoking it, you've already done this
part. If you used sous vide, pressure cooking, or oven:

You should hickory smoke the pork for at least an hour, ideally
two. You can do this on a Weber or other similar charcoal grill with a
lid either by placing hickory chips on hot coals (no need to wet
them) with the vents mostly closed, or by burning hickory chunk wood
(NOT charcoal). The pork will turn brown, and get almost black if you
leave it long enough. Generally you'll want to poke the fire /
replenish chips about once every half hour or so to keep the smoke
active.

If you don't have a fire available to you, you could *try* adding some
liquid smoke flavor to the shredded pork. But, I find the hickory
smoke flavor to be so essential to this, I've never tried it, and no
promises. Good luck, though!

SHREDDING THE PORK
At this point the pork should be very tender. Take it to a cutting
board, get two forks, and just pull the pork apart until you have a
bunch of shreds of pork. There will be a little bit of inedible
gristle and hunks of fat; just throw those away.

Add additional salt and pepper to taste if desired, and you may wish
to put some more BBQ sauce on the result.

Serve with the slaw. You can eat this straight off a plate, it's also
popular to serve it on hamburger buns, with the slaw on top of the
meat (my preference). I also like to serve it with homemade cornbread
and baked beans.
