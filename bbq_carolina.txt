Modernist here. Rub the pork with salt. No need to let it stand, since
it’s going to stand like crazy in the smoker.


Put in the smoker with hickory discs at 170.


Theory is, it’ll rapidly rise to about 150 (after something like 10
hours; happened while I was asleep, last time - more than six and less
than fifteen hours). After about eighteen hours total, the fat and
collagen beginning to run out will *lower* the temp of the shoulder,
to about 145. Once that process is complete, the temperature will *rise*
to 160+ and level off. Once that happens, you’re done.

Take 1 pork shoulder.


12 ounces of kosher salt and 2 quarts (8 cups) water. Heat the water
enough to let the salt dissolve, and then chill the water.


Place the pork shoulder in the water after it has cooled, and refrigerate
for 8-12 hours.


Remove, rinse, pat dry, and let rack dry for ideally a couple of hours.


Place in the smoker and smoke at 210 degrees until done, probably 8 -
12 hours, to an internal temperature of 180. Let rest two to three hours
before you cut it apart.

Piedmont or Lexingston style is what I really want. Difference is adding

cayenne pepper Pinch of crushed hot red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon sugar

Combine all ingredients in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. Cook,
stirring, until the sugar dissolves. Remove from the heat and let stand
until cool. Spoon a small amount of the sauce over barbecued meats. Yield:
three cups.

Lexington Style BBQ Slaw (a.k.a. Red Slaw)

1 lb green cabbage

4 tbsp ketchup or BBQ Sauce (80 g)

3 tbsp sugar (40 g)

1 tbsp cider vinegar

1/2 tsp salt

1/2 tsp red pepper flakes




Finely chop or hand grate cabbage. Mix together other ingredients (scaling
back seasonings to taste if BBQ sauce is used instead of ketchup), and
pour over cabbage. Stir to coat, and chill, covered in the refrigerator
for at least 20 minutes -- preferably longer to allow flavors to blend.
