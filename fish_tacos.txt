Garnishes:     Pico de gallo (or tomato mango avocado salsa)    
Crema Mexicana     1/2 C roughly chopped cilantro     2 limes, cut
into wedges     2 C shredded cabbage     12 6-inch tortillas    
1 avocado, cut into cubes, with lime juice squeezed all over them


Fish:     1 lbs firm white-fleshed fish, cut across the grain into
half-inch strips about 3 inches wide     1/2 C milk     1/2 C
fine-ground white flour     1 packet of Sazon      1/2 C peanut
oil     1 Tbsp ghee


Place the fish in a small bowl and cover with milk.


Mix the flour and sazon together in a shallow bowl.


Heat the oil in a cast-iron skillet over high heat until shimmering,
and add the ghee.


Take each fish fillet and place it in the flour and sazon dredge, coating
on all sides and shaking off any excess. Then, place in the skillet,
and cook for 3 minutes on one side, and 1 minute on the other. Remove
to a baking rack with a mesh on top of it, and place in a warm oven as
you complete the other fish.
