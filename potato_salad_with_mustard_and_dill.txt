Vinaigrette:

1/2 C extra-virgin olive oil
2 Tbsp brine from a jar of cornichons, gherkins or other small pickles, plus more as needed
1 Tbsp red wine vinegar
1 heaping teaspoon (the table kind) Dijon mustard
1 Tbsp honey
Kosher salt
Freshly ground black pepper

Potato Salad:

1 1/2 pounds small skin-on Yukon Gold or other yellow-fleshed potatoes, scrubbed and quartered
Kosher salt
8 cornichons, gherkins or other small pickles, finely chopped (about 1/2 cup)
1/2 C minced fresh dill
Freshly ground black pepper

Place the potatoes in pot and cover them with 1" of water. Place on
the stove and bring to a boil and cook until the potatoes are done
but still firm, 10 - 15 minutes. Drain the potatoes, place them back
in the pan and cover with cold water to help them cool for about ten
minutes. Once cool enough to work with (but still warm), quarter them
and toss them with the dill and chopped cornichons.

Place all the vinaigrette ingrediants in the stick blender cup and
blend until umulsified, then toss the potatoes in it.

Serve warm, or refrigerate to cool. Benefits from being made ahead so
the flavors can combine.
