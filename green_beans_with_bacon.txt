ORIGINAL:

2 1/2 pounds green beans, trimmed
Kosher salt
1/2 pound bacon, roughly chopped
1 small yellow onion, finely chopped
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 teaspoon red pepper flakes
1/2 cup chopped toasted pecans
Juice of 1/2 lemon
Freshly ground pepper

Toss the green beans into a large pot of boiling salted water and cook
until bright green in color and crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Drain
the beans and shock in a large bowl of ice water to stop the
cooking. Drain the beans again and pat dry.

Cook the bacon in a large, heavy saute pan until crisp, about 5
minutes. Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Spoon
off the excess bacon grease, leaving 2 tablespoons in the pan. Add the
onion to the pan and saute until soft and very tender, 4 to 5
minutes. Sprinkle in the garlic and red pepper flakes and saute until
just fragrant, about 1 more minute. Add the reserved green beans and
the pecans and cook until heated through, 5 to 6 minutes more. Return
the bacon to the pan, pour in the lemon juice and toss. Season with
salt and pepper.
