2-3 cans of high-quality tuna, or 1 lb of your homemade tunafish 4
T. diced celery (2 stalks)

chopped parsley (optional) 1/4 t. cayenne (optional) Salt and pepper to
taste Preparation:

Flake the tuna into chunks. If you bought it oil-packed, as I recommend,
let it be coated in oil. Don't wash the tuna.  Mix the tuna with all
the other ingredients in a bowl. Test for salt and add it to taste.
