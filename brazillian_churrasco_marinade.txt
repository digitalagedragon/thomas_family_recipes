1/2 cup lime juice
1/3 cup dry red wine
2 teaspoons olive oil
2 garlic cloves, minced
1 onion, minced
1 tablespoon dried oregano
2 bay leaves
1 teaspoon fresh-ground black pepper
1 scotch bonnet or jalapeno pepper, minced, optional


First time I made it I also put in 1/4 C low-sodium soy sauce since there's no salt there
