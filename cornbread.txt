10 Tbsp (140 g) unsalted butter + 3 Tbsp
240 g cornmeal (good quality stone ground cornmeal preferred)
60 gr all-purpose flour
1 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
2 tsp kosher salt
2 Tbsp (25 gr) sugar
1 1/2 cup (355 ml) buttermilk
2 large eggs

Preheat the oven to 450F.

Melt the butter in the cast iron skillet. I tried browning the butter,
and it was great fresh but too much cold as leftovers.

Whisk together dry ingredients. Add wet ingredients (leaving about 2
Tbsp of browned butter in the pan to grease it) and stir to
combine.

Pour the batter in the cast iron skillet and bake for 20 minutes or
until a tester comes out with moist crumb from the center.

Immediately after removing it from the oven, spread the remaining
butter over the top of the cornbread and let it melt in.
