1 C (215g) rice (N.B.! This is one ACTUAL cup, not rice-cooker cup, see liquid
below)
1/2 medium onion, chopped
4 cloves garlic, chopped
2 Tbsp butter
1/2 tsp tumeric
1/2 tsp cumin
1/2 tsp salt
1 can drained black beans
2C (500g) of chicken stock

Dump everything but the beans in the rice cooker and cook it. When
that's done, drain the beans and mix them in.

with the beans added at the last minute. Also used a whole onion,
and it was too much.
