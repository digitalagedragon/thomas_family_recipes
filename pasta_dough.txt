Ingredients:









Place all ingredients in mixing bowl, and mix together using flat mixer until combined, about two minutes.


Switch to bread hook and knead for 2 minutes.


Dust a work surface (and your hands) with flour, and knead by hand for 2 minutes.


Double-wrap the dough in plastic wrap  and let rest for 30 minutes - 1 hour before rolling through pasta machine. Dough can be made a day ahead, wrapped and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before rolling.


Divide into six balls of dough (about 65g each). Flatten each ball until they’re about 3/8” thick. Run through once on 1, fold over, and run through again at 1.


Run through at 2, 3, and 4.


If making spaghetti or fetuccini, put in the cutting attachment, and cut each piece.


For spaghetti, boil for 3 minutes. For fettucini, 4.
