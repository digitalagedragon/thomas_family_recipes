3 C flour 1 tbsp sugar 2 tsp baking powder 1 tsp sesame oil 1/2 tsp salt
3 tbsp melted butter 3 eggs 3 C Egg Nog


Combine the dry ingredients, and mix well.


Beat the eggs.  Melt the butter.  Mix the butter into the eggs.  Add
the egg nog to the wet ingredients.


Mix all the wet into the dry, stirring vigorously and for as short a
period of time as possible.


Notes:


20051204:  Forgot the salt.  Could barely taste the sesame oil.  1
1/4 tsp next time?  I believe I did 2 tsp last Christmas and it was WAY
too much.  They also were a little dense and chewey - perhaps a little
lemon juice + baking soda?


20071202:  Added to regular pancake recipe
