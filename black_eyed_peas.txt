1 lbs pork shoulder

1/2 onion, diced 12 cloves garlic, diced 2 stalks celery, diced 2 carrots,
diced 16 oz dried black eyed peas, soaked overnight in cold water and
drained 4 cups (32 oz) chicken stock 4 cups water Dash of cumin Ground
Red Pepper 2 bay leaves 28 oz diced tomatoes



Cooked just pork and mirepoix with garlic and spices after browning the
pork shoulder. Cooked for 1 hour at 275, then put in black eyed peas
and cooked for 1 hour. Beans were overdone. Pork was perfect.


Hamhocks are a bad idea, they give it a bad flavor.  8 Cups of liquid
was way too much - 4 would probably be fine


I think for next year (2014):


Cook meat and mirepoix with garlic and spices for 90 minutes. Put beans
in for 30. Then, figure out what to do with the tomatoes. One 28 oz can
might not be enough.
